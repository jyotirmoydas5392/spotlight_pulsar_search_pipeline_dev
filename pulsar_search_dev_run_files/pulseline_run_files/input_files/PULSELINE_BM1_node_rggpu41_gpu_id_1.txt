# Parameters for Beam level Candidate Sorting
# ---------------------------------------------------

                                 #   0 = If beam level sifting is disabled in input_file_directory.txt file

# ---------------------------------------------------
# Notes
# - Ensure all input files and directories are accessible before execution.
# - DM range (start_DM, end_DM, dm_step) should match the values used during the AA search.
# - Modify these parameters based on the specifics of the data and desired search precision.
